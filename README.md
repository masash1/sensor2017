# sensor2017

A OpenCV used assignment of Sensor 2017 at CIT

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to write and test a code 
that calculates the distance between a camera and target 
face by using OpenCV functions and a simple Z-transform algorithm.

## Environment

I tested at ...
Ubuntu 16.04
OpenCV 3.2.0

## Setup and Test

* Install and setup OpenCV.

* Clone this repository.
```
$ git clone
```

* Prepare a video file (mp4 is recommended) and a cascade file from OpenCV directory.

* Run the execution file.
```
$ make && ./main
```
